# SANDMAN: Sandboxed Multi-Agent Network

Private repo for the SANDMAN project. Please contribute to this README with any new ideas or concepts that you may have.

## Project Overview

The SANDMAN (**S**imulated **A**gent **N**etwork for **D**efense via **M**ulti-**A**gent **N**egotiation) project is an innovative venture in the realm of cybersecurity, leveraging advanced artificial intelligence to simulate user behavior within digital environments. Our goal is to create highly realistic, dynamic simulations that serve as deceptive landscapes to mislead and analyze potential cyber attackers, while enhancing the robustness of cybersecurity defenses.

## Objectives

- To develop a sophisticated simulation of user behavior using a network of virtual agents.
- To create a realistic digital environment that can effectively deceive cyber attackers.
- To provide a dynamic and adaptable platform for cybersecurity training and defense strategy enhancement.
- To advance the understanding and implementation of proactive cybersecurity measures.

## Core Components

1. User Behavior Modeling (UBM): Utilizing a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to represent typical user actions and transitions within a digital environment.
2. Language Model Integration: Incorporating a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model for realistic content generation, including emails and documents.
3. Artifact Generation: Simulating the creation of digital artifacts with realistic metadata to enhance the deception.
4. User Profile Management: Developing distinct user profiles to diversify and customize behavior patterns within the simulation.
5. System Interaction Simulation: Mimicking interactions with the Windows operating system to reflect authentic user activities.
6. Adaptive Learning Mechanism: Implementing feedback systems to refine and evolve user behavior models over time.

## Elevator Pitch

The SANDMAN project is a groundbreaking initiative at the forefront of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Our project represents a paradigm shift in digital defense strategies, focusing on the simulation of user behavior to create highly realistic, deceptive environments for cyber attackers.

At its core, SANDMAN utilizes advanced AI to simulate a network of virtual users, each exhibiting unique, realistic behaviors. This is not just about generating random digital activities; it's about creating a detailed, dynamic world where each simulated user's actions are indistinguishable from real ones. By doing so, we're not just setting traps; we're building entire landscapes of deception.

Why is this important? In today's digital age, attackers are constantly evolving, using sophisticated methods to breach systems. Traditional security measures are often one step behind, playing catch-up. SANDMAN changes the game. By populating a system with these realistic simulations, we effectively mask real user data, confuse attackers, and waste their resources, all while gathering intelligence and learning from their tactics.

Our approach is not just theoretical. It has practical applications in cybersecurity training, red/blue team exercises, and enhancing overall system security. Imagine being able to train your cybersecurity team in an environment that is as complex and unpredictable as the real world, or having a system that constantly adapts to emerging threats.

SANDMAN is more than just a project; it's a leap towards a future where our digital environments are as resilient and adaptive as we are. We're not just defending against threats; we're outsmarting them.
