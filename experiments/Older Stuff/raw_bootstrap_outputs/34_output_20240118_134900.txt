Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have the capability to generate real-time, specific schedules or tasks. However, I can provide you with an example of a daily routine in JSON format using the given task list. Please note that the specific times for each task are not included in this example and would need to be added.

{
  "schedule": [
    {"time": "08:00", "task": "BreakTask"},
    {"time": "09:00", "task": "EmailTask"},
    {"time": "12:00", "task": "LunchTask"},
    {"time": "13:00", "task": "MeetingTask"},
    {"time": "14:30", "task": "NothingTask"},
    {"time": "15:00", "task": "WebTask"},
    {"time": "16:00", "task": "WriteDocumentSpreadsheetTask"},
    {"time": "17:30", "task": "WriteDocumentPresentationTask"},
    {"time": "19:00", "task": "WriteCodeTask"},
    {"time": "20:30", "task": "WriteDocumentTask"},
    {"time": "21:30", "task": "ResearchTask"},
    {"time": "22:30", "task": "DataAnalysisTask"}
  ]
}
