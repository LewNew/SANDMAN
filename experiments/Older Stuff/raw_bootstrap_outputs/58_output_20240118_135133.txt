Here's an example of a daily routine with tasks randomly chosen from the provided list:

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "time": "08:00 AM",
      "task": "NothingTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "09:00 AM",
      "task": "ResearchTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "10:30 AM",
      "task": "MeetingTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "11:30 AM",
      "task": "LunchTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "01:00 PM",
      "task": "EmailTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "02:30 PM",
      "task": "WriteDocumentTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "04:00 PM",
      "task": "DataAnalysisTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "06:00 PM",
      "task": "BreakTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "06:30 PM",
      "task": "WebTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "08:00 PM",
      "task": "WriteCodeTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "09:30 PM",
      "task": "WriteDocumentSpreadsheetTask"
    },
    {
      "time": "10:30 PM",
      "task": "WriteDocumentPresentationTask"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the tasks are randomly shuffled, and the time slots are set according to a fictional daily routine. Feel free to adjust the time slots and tasks according to your specific needs.
