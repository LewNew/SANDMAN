Here is an example of a daily routine with randomly selected tasks:

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {"time": "08:00 AM", "task": "BreakTask"},
    {"time": "08:15 AM", "task": "EmailTask"},
    {"time": "09:00 AM", "task": "WriteDocumentTask"},
    {"time": "10:00 AM", "task": "MeetingTask"},
    {"time": "11:00 AM", "task": "WebTask"},
    {"time": "12:30 PM", "task": "LunchTask"},
    {"time": "01:30 PM", "task": "WriteCodeTask"},
    {"time": "03:00 PM", "task": "ResearchTask"},
    {"time": "04:30 PM", "task": "WriteDocumentSpreadsheetTask"},
    {"time": "05:30 PM", "task": "DataAnalysisTask"},
    {"time": "06:30 PM", "task": "WriteDocumentPresentationTask"},
    {"time": "07:30 PM", "task": "NothingTask"}
  ]
}
```

Please note that the tasks and schedule are randomly selected and may not represent an actual daily routine accurately. Feel free to adjust the tasks and their timing according to your specific requirements.
