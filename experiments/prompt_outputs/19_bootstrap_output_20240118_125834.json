To create a daily routine with randomly selected tasks from the provided list, we can use the Python programming language. Here's an example code snippet that generates a daily schedule with tasks randomly assigned to different time slots:

```python
import random
import json

# List of tasks to choose from
tasks_list = [
    'BreakTask', 'EmailTask', 'LunchTask', 'MeetingTask', 'NothingTask', 'WebTask',
    'WriteDocumentSpreadsheetTask', 'WriteDocumentPresentationTask',
    'WriteCodeTask', 'WriteDocumentTask', 'ResearchTask', 'DataAnalysisTask'
]

# Create a list to store the daily schedule
schedule = []

# Define the number of time slots in a day
time_slots = 8

# Assign tasks randomly to time slots
for time in range(time_slots):
    task = random.choice(tasks_list)
    schedule.append({'time': time, 'task': task})

# Create a dictionary to hold the schedule
output = {'schedule': schedule}

# Convert the dictionary to JSON format
json_output = json.dumps(output)

# Print the JSON output
print(json_output)
```

When you run the above code, it will generate a random daily routine with tasks assigned to different time slots. The output will be in JSON format and will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "schedule": [
        {"time": 0, "task": "DataAnalysisTask"},
        {"time": 1, "task": "MeetingTask"},
        {"time": 2, "task": "WriteDocumentTask"},
        {"time": 3, "task": "EmailTask"},
        {"time": 4, "task": "WebTask"},
        {"time": 5, "task": "WriteCodeTask"},
        {"time": 6, "task": "LunchTask"},
        {"time": 7, "task": "BreakTask"}
    ]
}
```

Please note that this code randomly assigns tasks and time slots; the generated routine will likely differ each time you run the script.
